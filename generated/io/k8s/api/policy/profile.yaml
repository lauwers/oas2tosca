  Eviction:
    description: >-
      Eviction evicts a pod from its node subject to certain policies and
      safety constraints. This is a subresource of Pod.  A request to cause
      such an eviction is created by POSTing to .../pods/<pod
      name>/evictions.

        description: >-
          An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by
          "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of
          the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions
          by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with
          "minAvailable".

          "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in
          the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all
          voluntary evictions by specifying "100%".

      selector:

          Label query over pods whose evictions are managed by the disruption
          budget. A null selector will match no pods, while an empty ({})
          selector will select all pods within the namespace.

  PodDisruptionBudgetStatus:

      conditions:
        description: >-
          Conditions contain conditions for PDB. The disruption controller sets the DisruptionAllowed condition. The following are known values for the reason field (additional reasons could be added in the future): - SyncFailed: The controller encountered an error and wasn't able to compute
          the number of allowed disruptions. Therefore no disruptions are
          allowed and the status of the condition will be False.
          - InsufficientPods: The number of pods are either at or below the number
          required by the PodDisruptionBudget. No disruptions are
          allowed and the status of the condition will be False.
          - SufficientPods: There are more pods than required by the PodDisruptionBudget.
          The condition will be True, and the number of allowed
          disruptions are provided by the disruptionsAllowed property.

      disruptedPods:
        description: >-
          DisruptedPods contains information about pods whose eviction was
          processed by the API server eviction subresource handler but has not
          yet been observed by the PodDisruptionBudget controller. A pod will be
          in this map from the time when the API server processed the eviction
          request to the time when the pod is seen by PDB controller as having
          been marked for deletion (or after a timeout). The key in the map is
          the name of the pod and the value is the time when the API server
          processed the eviction request. If the deletion didn't occur and a pod
          is still there it will be removed from the list automatically by
          PodDisruptionBudget controller after some time. If everything goes
          smooth this map should be empty for the most of the time. Large number
          of entries in the map may indicate problems with pod deletions.
